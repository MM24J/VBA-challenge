# Stock Market Analysis

For this analysis I used historical stock market data over a 3 year period (2018-2020). Using VBA, I created a script that loops through the stock data for 1 year which outputs the stock's ticker symbol, the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year, the percentage change from the opening prices at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year, and the total volume of the stock. I added functionality to my script to output the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and Greatest Total Volume. Conditional formatting was used to highlight positive and negative changes.
